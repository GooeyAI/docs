* Change or correct just a tiny bit in the image
* Remove your ex!!&#x20;

&#x20;_**This tool is great for artist to create iterations on top of their sketches!**_&#x20;

### Step 1 : Choose your image

Choose an image that you want to improve or change See the example below:

<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dara-c1b52.appspot.com/daras_ai/media/6d8713c8-6738-11ed-a5bc-8e93953183ba/PHOTO-2022-11-16-18-34-45.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Upload

Upload the image to the Edit an Image with AI tool.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 1.01.16 PM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Step 3: Add a prompt&#x20;

Think of the style and look that you want for your picture and add it to the prompt section:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 1.03.17 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can use the prompt below:

```
an art deco house near a beach, beautiful sunset, A beautiful anime drawing full of joy, with colorful background, studio ghibli, ponyo, anime, excited, anime, saturated colors
```

### Step 4: Hit Submit
