# Feedback

Feedback buttons are a quick and simple way of getting user inputs directly in the AI Agent. User can rate and provide feedback on every AI Agent.

## Activate feedback buttons in your AI Agent

By default, the feedback buttons are switched off in your AI Agent Deployment. You can scroll down to the "Show Demo Button" section and switch on the Feedback buttons settings.&#x20;

### Detailed Feedback

When users give a thumbs down, ask them to explain what was wrong and how it could be improved. Make sure to use our suggested prompt in your agent to make this work well.
