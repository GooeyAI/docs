# Analysis and Observability

Analytics dashboards help you manage your AI agents by giving you a clear view of how they’re performing. You can check how often users are engaging with the Agent, where errors happen, and how resources are being used—all in one place. This makes it easier for you to spot problems, track progress, and make improvements so your agents work more smoothly and deliver better results.
