# What to do BEFORE You Build a Bot

**Identify your use case and value hypothesis**. Where do you believe an AI bot may be useful? To which customers or people?&#x20;

**How will you measure the bot's value?** Usually, that is:&#x20;

1. \# of messages sent
2. D1, D3, D7, D30 Retention of users
3. Positive vs negative feedback from users
4. % of questions asked by the user that were answered by the bot

**Curate the knowledge base dataset** e.g. documents, videos, PDFs, websites, and soon real-time data sources.&#x20;

**Create "Golden" Questions and Answers**

Let’s assume a human expert understood all of the documents in the above knowledge base dataset and then one of your users asked the human expert a question; what ideal answer would you expect the human expert to provide? This is the _Golden Answer._

1. Collect 10 questions and the ideal **Golden Answer** for each
2. The question should be captured in whatever form we believe the user is likely to ask it - e.g. in Bhojpuri as a WhatsApp audio note, mixed-Hinglish text, English text, and/or Tamil text.
3. If non-English, provide the English text translation of the question
4. The ideal “golden” answer in English text
5. Collect the above as rows in the Excel or Google sheet.
