# How does RAG-based document search work?

Large Language Models are trained on a huge amount of data, yet when you search for your organization or brand, you might find that it usually can’t respond accurately. This means that LLMs might hallucinate (or “make up”) irrelevant or inaccurate information for your business needs.

This is why Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an excellent solution! RAG will:

1. Index all of your knowledge base in a vectorDB - pdfs, csvs, texts, web pages, images, and more
2. Retrieve all the most relevant information from the vectorDB
3. Use LLM to provide summaries that work for your use case and generate accurate answers

#### Step 1: Prepare your knowledge base <a href="#id-7ycp7arvb983" id="id-7ycp7arvb983"></a>

You can upload all your documents and data in the “Documents” section. You can add PDFs, docs, spreadsheets, charts, and texts.

**These can be uploaded from your local drive or online hosted links. We even accept Google Drive links.**
