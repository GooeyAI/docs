### Step 1: Choose Your Stable Diffusion Prompt

Start by providing a prompt for the AI Art process. This will influence the artistic style of your QR code. For example, change the default prompt from "busy street of Mumbai" to "on the surface of Mars" for a space-themed QR code.

Our system will then generate a QR image, which is cleaned up and processed using control net and stable diffusion to create unique outputs. You can use your phone to scan and test the readability of these QR codes.

### Advanced Settings

For those who want to fine-tune their QR code's appearance, advanced settings are available:

\- **Model Selection:** Choose from different models like Dream Shaper, Analog Diffusion, or Protogen.

\- **Control Net Settings**: Adjust tiling and brightness to your preference.

\- **Conditional Scales**: Set the balance between the QR code and the image using a scale from 0 to 2. A setting of 0.3 to 0.5 is recommended for a balanced blend.

#### Adjusting the **Conditional Scales**

To illustrate the effect of the visibility balance setting:

\- A setting close to 0 will emphasize the stable diffusion image over the QR code.

\- A setting close to 2 will prioritize the QR code's visibility over the image.

Experiment with this setting to achieve your desired balance between the QR code and the background image.

#### Custom Formats and Placement

Our tool also allows for customization of the QR code's shape and placement within the image. You can choose from different formats like square or smartphone, and decide where to position the QR code.

#### Additional Features
