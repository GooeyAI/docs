### Advanced Settings <a href="#bek5b9uth2re" id="bek5b9uth2re"></a>

#### Face Padding <a href="#id-7micoj491pkj" id="id-7micoj491pkj"></a>

You can use the ‚ÄúFace Padding‚Äù settings to improve the accuracy of the detected face in the image/video. This ensures that the Lip Sync video looks more realistic.

#### Speech Provider <a href="#a5bhfdq8ob29" id="a5bhfdq8ob29"></a>

Our Lip Sync Animation generator includes several Speech PRovider services. We have detailed each of them below, and speech provider would suit your needs the best.

**Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**

Google offers a range of voices and accents.

How to use the settings:

* You can select the voice from the dropdown.
* To hear the various voice samples you can click on the link that is circled in red.
* Use the ‚ÄúSpeaking rate‚Äù and ‚ÄúPitch‚Äù settings to ensure that the voice sounds closest to your brand and character‚Äôs personality.

Note: If you are looking for consistent, long-form speech across many languages, then Google is an excellent choice. But, the voice will sound a little robotic, and many not work for uses that require expressive and emotional speech synthesis.

**ElevenLabs**

ElevenLabs is currently one of the most popular synthetic voice services. They offer fast, accurate speech synthesis, with very realistic human tones.

How to use the settings:

* Choose a voice from the ‚ÄúVoice Name‚Äù dropdown box
* Choose a ‚ÄúVoice Model‚Äù - we recommend using ‚ÄúMultilingual V2‚Äù for more accuracy, more languages covered, more natural sounding voices and more stability
* Stability setting - A lower stability provides a broader emotional range. A value lower than 0.3 can lead to too much instability.
* Similarity Boost setting - Dictates how hard the model should try to replicate the original voice.
* Style Exagerration setting - This setting attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It requires more compute power and also increases the latency. We recommend you keep this setting on 0.

_**Custom Voice settings**_
