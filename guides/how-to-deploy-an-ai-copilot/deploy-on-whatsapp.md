### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I have got a new number for the WhatsApp integration but it isn't working. What should I do?**

A: There could be a few reasons why this isn't working, please AVOID these steps:

* You have activated the sim card on a smartphone with WhatsApp messaging app
* You have registered the phone number directly on Facebook
* You have registered the phone number directly on Whatsapp Manager

Please avoid this, you will not be able to integrate Gooey Copilot on that number until you deactivate all these things.&#x20;

**Q: The integration worked successfully, but it's not working now. Why is this?**

A: We have commonly found that after successful integration users/organizations try to use the connected phone number on the WhatsApp client for messages sent by human experts. Once you have integrated the WhatsApp bot with your AI Copilot, you can't have additional human-sent messages like other WhatsApp Business Accounts.&#x20;

**Q: The integration worked successfully, why did the bot stop working after the first day?**

A: If you don't connect a credit card to your Facebook Account for the bot, it will deactivate in 24 hours.  There won't be any additional charge from Facebook but they require a credit card to activate the account. Once you add a card there will be a business verification process.
