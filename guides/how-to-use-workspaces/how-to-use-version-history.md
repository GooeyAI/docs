# How to use Version History?

If you want to revert to a past version of your AI Workflow, you can use our version history tool in Workspaces.

This is useful if:

* You realize that your newly “Saved” workflow is failing or not successful
* You accidentally clicked “Update” and your Workflow wasn’t ready or was incomplete
* You want to use the previous version of an AI Workflow and “fork” it

#### Step 1: Click on the “Options” button on the top right as circled here in red. <a href="#id-3sl778mlih78" id="id-3sl778mlih78"></a>
