# How to use Workspaces?

With Workspaces, you will be able to:

1. Collaborate on saved workflows
2. Access the [Version History](how-to-use-version-history.md) of saved workflows (with comments and the ability to revert to the previous version)
3. Share payment methods (so you can cover the Gooey usage cost for your team members)
4. Assign roles and access levels for team members&#x20;
5. Shared API secrets (to securely access private APIs)
6. Manage multiple teams independently, each with their own billing details and saved workflows
