# How to use Compare AI Translations?

Along with ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and LLM Copilot usage, many Gooey.AI customers have been using translation models for their user base.

Compare AI translation models allow you to add customized AI translation to your Gooey.AI workflow.

**We currently host Google Translate, GhanaNLP.**

### Why host so many translation models? <a href="#id-4vok3el2bz95" id="id-4vok3el2bz95"></a>

**For many of our customers serving non-English speaking users is vital to their business process.**

> Low-resource languages are not uniform. Local dialects abound. Unfortunately, capturing this diversity of language is hard for tech companies attempting to make speech recognition and translation models. This paucity of high-quality diverse training sets then leads to poor performance of AI models. This poor performance then implies that incredible tools like GPT4 and Gemini - which are primarily trained on English - don’t work particularly well for speakers of low-resource languages.

Translation models are built for general use, so pronouns like brand names, technical terms, specific terms for your use case should not be mistranslated! In the “Translation Glossary” you can add a simple excel/google sheet to ensure that your important terms are not mistranslated.
