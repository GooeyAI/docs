{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: The team or personal icon on top determines whose credits you are using for a run. If you hit "Run" on any Gooey.AI workflow and the "personal" icon is on the top right, it means your credits from the "personal" workspace will be debited.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Q: How can I manage my Workspace settings?
