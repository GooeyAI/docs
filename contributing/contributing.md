### **üë©‚Äçüíª Ways to contribute** <a href="#srvcn5b1nf7z" id="srvcn5b1nf7z"></a>

There are many ways to contribute to Gooey.AI. Here are some ways you can contribute:

* [**Documentation**](documentation-style-guide.md): Help improve our docs, including this one!
* [**Code**](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-server): Help us write code, fix bugs, or improve our infrastructure.
* **Integrations**: Help us integrate with your favorite communication platform, vendors and tools.
* [**Discussions**](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-server/discussions): Help answer usage questions and discuss issues with users.
* **Shared AI Recipes**: Create amazing AI workflows on Gooey and save them publicly on your profile page so others can fork them.

### **üö© GitHub Issues** <a href="#wq90yd4qlpci" id="wq90yd4qlpci"></a>

Our [issues](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-server/issues) page is kept up to date with bugs, improvements, and feature requests.

There is a taxonomy of labels to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help organize issues.

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature. If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up-to-date as possible, though with the rapid rate of development in this field some may get out of date. If you notice this happening, please let us know.

### **üêõ Fix Bugs**

Most bugs are reported and tracked in the Github Issues Page. We try our best in triaging and tagging these issues:

* Issues tagged as `bug` are confirmed bugs.
* New contributors may want to start with issues tagged with `good first issue`.

Please feel free to open an issue and/or assign an issue to yourself.

### **üí≠ GitHub Discussions** <a href="#mdugft7kjty8" id="mdugft7kjty8"></a>

We have a [Github Discussions](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-server/discussions) page where users can ask usage questions, discuss design decisions, and propose new features.

If you can help answer questions, please do so! This will allow the maintainers to spend more time focused on development and bug fixing.

### **üôã Getting Help** <a href="#nx18z0xou2uf" id="nx18z0xou2uf"></a>

Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting set up, please reach out on Discord ([https://gooey.ai/discord](https://gooey.ai/discord)) or contact a team member at support@gooey.ai!! Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we also want to make sure that the process is smooth for future contributors.

We do enforce certain linting, formatting, and documentation standards in the codebase. If you find these difficult (or even just annoying) to work with, feel free to contact a maintainer for help - we do not want these to get in the way of getting good code into the codebase.
